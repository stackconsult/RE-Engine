- `README.md` — repo entry point (what to run first)
- `REengine-readme.md` — original MVP save-point (legacy reference)

## Keystone System Components
- `docs/REENGINE-ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture and component integration
- `docs/RELIABILITY-SYSTEM.md` — prevent/detect/recover/predict; failure taxonomy
