# Self-Healing System

## Core Reliability Mechanisms
- **Distributed Locking**: Prevent overlapping execution across multiple instances
- **Adaptive Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter and circuit breaker patterns
- **Comprehensive Artifact Capture**: Structured logging, distributed tracing, error snapshots
- **Intelligent Failure Classification**: ML-driven categorization of root causes
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks and predictive failure detection

## Recovery & Remediation
- **Dynamic Recovery Playbook**: Context-aware recovery strategies based on failure patterns
- **Safe Automated Remediation**: Non-destructive auto-fixes with human approval gates
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automatic state restoration on failed recoveries
- **Incident Correlation**: Cross-system failure analysis and impact assessment

## Monitoring & Diagnostics
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates with trend analysis
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, network monitoring with alerting
- **Dependency Health**: External service monitoring and cascade failure prevention
- **Audit Trail**: Complete execution history for compliance and debugging
